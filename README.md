# Computer-Systems-Architecture

This repository contains projects and assignments developed for the **Computer Systems Architecture** course, taken in the 1st year of the Applied Computer Science program.

## Repository Structure

- `circuits` – Logisim (.circ) files covering the basics of digital circuits:
  - Logic gates and combinational circuits
  - Arithmetic circuits (adder, subtractor, etc.)
  - Multiplexers
  - Flip-flops
  - Simple logic units
- `assembly` – Basic assembly programs (e.g., displaying a "Hello" message).

## Topics Covered

- Fundamentals of digital circuit design  
- Combinational and sequential circuits  
- Multiplexers and flip-flops  
- Basic arithmetic units  
- Introduction to assembly language
